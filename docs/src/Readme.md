# Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to libextend. 

This project was really borne out of a realization my freshman year of college that I was writing the same code over and over again. For instance, have
you ever had to print out the contents of a vector? I have. Many, many times. I've written that for loop probably 200 times and quite frankly, I'm over
it. But there are other things that I've found to be boilerplate or highly repetitive over the last 3 years, and I made on and off attemtps to write 
something like this library as time has passed. Finally this spring I decided that it was worth it to start collecting this code as I wrote it.

I am a naturally curious person, and once I got a taste of real development, unencumbered by university restrictions on what you can use from stack
overflow, I was hooked. I've been at this for a month now and every day I learn something. So I decided that it would be a fun project to put on
GitHub and to just see what happened with it. I hope you find it useful, honestly nothing would make me happier. 

Just so we're clear on a few things, you are more than welcome to use anything you find here for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, I really
don't care. I'm going to use the MIT License to make sure of that. Also, know that this is a passion project of mine, not a production tested and 
verified thing, entirely developed in my spare time as I have a desire to add functionality (which is all the time right now, frustratingly, normally
in the middle of class... (sorry professors)). So if you see something missing, or there are bugs, my challenge to you is to do what I did: take a stab
at fixing it. Nothing could be better for the future of software than people getting their hands dirty with code that matters to them.

With that, I'll leave you to the code.
